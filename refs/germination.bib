	abstract = {Priority effects play a key role in structuring natural communities, but considerable confusion remains about how they affect different ecological systems. Synthesizing previous studies, we show that this confusion arises because the mechanisms driving priority and the temporal scale at which they operate differ among studies, leading to divergent outcomes in species interactions and biodiversity patterns. We suggest grouping priority effects into two functional categories based on their mechanisms: frequency-dependent priority effects that arise from positive frequency dependence, and trait-dependent priority effects that arise from time-dependent changes in interacting traits. Through easy quantification of these categories from experiments, we can construct community models representing diverse biological mechanisms and interactions with priority effects, therefore better predicting their consequences across ecosystems.},

	n2 = {Abstract Plant phenology, the annually recurring sequence of plant developmental stages, is important for plant functioning and ecosystem services and their biophysical and biogeochemical feedbacks to the climate system. Plant phenology depends on temperature, and the current rapid climate change has revived interest in understanding and modeling the responses of plant phenology to the warming trend and the consequences thereof for ecosystems. Here, we review recent progresses in plant phenology and its interactions with climate change. Focusing on the start (leaf unfolding) and end (leaf coloring) of plant growing seasons, we show that the recent rapid expansion in ground- and remote sensing- based phenology data acquisition has been highly beneficial and has supported major advances in plant phenology research. Studies using multiple data sources and methods generally agree on the trends of advanced leaf unfolding and delayed leaf coloring due to climate change, yet these trends appear to have decelerated or even reversed in recent years. Our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the plant phenology responses to climate warming is still limited. The interactions between multiple drivers complicate the modeling and prediction of plant phenology changes. Furthermore, changes in plant phenology have important implications for ecosystem carbon cycles and ecosystem feedbacks to climate, yet the quantification of such impacts remains challenging. We suggest that future studies should primarily focus on using new observation tools to improve the understanding of tropical plant phenology, on improving process-based phenology modeling, and on the scaling of phenology from species to landscape-level.},

Classical approaches to the study of phenology have typically documented changes in the timing of single life-history events, while phenological shifts affect many interactions over entire life histories. In this study, we suggest an approach that integrates the phenology and ontogeny of species interactions with a fitness landscape to provide a common mechanistic framework for investigating phenological shifts. We suggest that this ontogeny?phenology landscape provides a flexible method to document changes in the relative phenologies of interacting species, examine the causes of these phenological shifts, and estimate their consequences for interacting species.

	n2 = {Abstract A general model shows how the long-term growth rate of a population can be partitioned into components representing various mechanisms of maintenance of species diversity. One component summarises the effects of fluctuation-independent mechanisms, which include classical resource partitioning and frequency-dependent herbivory. Two other components represent fluctuation-dependent mechanisms, the storage effect and relative nonlinearity of competition. The general model shows how a community will track an equilibrium set by fluctuation-independent mechanisms and the environmental state when community dynamics are faster than the rate of environmental change. Fluctuation-dependent mechanisms can be important for diversity maintenance with or without such tracking, but on long timescales their effects are indistinguishable from those of fluctuation-independent mechanisms. These considerations lead to a hierarchical view of mechanisms of diversity maintenance where the effects of different timescales are partitioned or merged depending on the timescale of observation. These issues are illustrated with model examples involving various combinations of resource partitioning, fluctuations in recruitment rates, variation in the timing of germination, and seasonality. The very long timescales associated with climate change contain many complexities but nevertheless many ideas applicable to shorter timescales may be useful in a modified form.},

Despite the intuitive appeal of the idea that no species can be a master of all trades, there has been a scarcity of linked demographic and physiological evidence to support the role of resource use tradeoffs in natural systems. Using five species of Chihuahuan desert summer annual plants, I show that demographic tradeoffs driven by short-term soil moisture variation act as a mechanism to allow multiple species to partition a limiting resource. Specifically, by achieving highest fitness in either rainfall pulse or interpulse periods, variability reduces fitness differences through time that could promote coexistence on a limiting resource. Differences in fitness are explained in part by the response of photosynthesis to changing soil moisture. My results suggest that increasing weather variability, as predicted under climate change, could increase the opportunity for coexistence in this community.},

Here, we show that warming and drying of the Southwestern United States over the last 25 years has corresponded to a shift in the species composition of Sonoran Desert winter annuals, paradoxically favoring species that germinate and grow best in cold temperatures. Winter rains have been arriving later in the season, during December rather than October, leading to the unexpected result that plants are germinating under colder temperatures, shifting community composition to favor slow growing, water-use efficient, cold-adapted species. Our results demonstrate how detailed ecophysiological knowledge of individual species, combined with long-term demographic data, can reveal complex and sometimes unexpected shifts in community composition in response to climate change. Further, these results highlight the potentially overwhelming impact of changes in phenology on the response of biota to a changing climate.},

Using a broad literature review of common garden studies published between 1941 and 2017, we documented the commonness of these three signatures in plants native to North America's Great Basin, an area of extensive restoration and revegetation efforts, and asked which traits and environmental variables were involved. We also asked, independent of geographic distance, whether populations from more similar environments had more similar traits. From 327 experiments testing 121 taxa in 170 studies, we found 95.1{\%} of 305 experiments reported among-population differences, and 81.4{\%} of 161 experiments reported trait-by-environment associations. Locals showed greater survival in 67{\%} of 24 reciprocal experiments that reported survival, and higher fitness in 90{\%} of 10 reciprocal experiments that reported reproductive output. A meta-analysis on a subset of studies found that variation in eight commonly measured traits was associated with mean annual precipitation and mean annual temperature at the source location, with notably strong relationships for flowering phenology, leaf size, and survival, among others. Although the Great Basin is sometimes perceived as a region of homogeneous ecosystems, our results demonstrate widespread habitat-related population differentiation and local adaptation. Locally sourced plants likely harbor adaptations at rates and magnitudes that are immediately relevant to restoration success, and our results suggest that certain key traits and environmental variables should be prioritized in future assessments of plants in this region.},

	abstract = {Little is known about the influence of forest management on the interaction between seed bank and aboveground vegetation. We surveyed seed banks and vegetation in 10 forest stands under similar abiotic conditions but submitted either to a coppice-with-standards treatment (n = 5) or to a selective-cutting system (n = 5). We analyzed species composition and diversity, community ecological profile, and distribution of taxa among different life forms, strategy, morphology and functional type categories. A total of 2085 seedlings (8296 seeds m−2) germinated-corresponding to 28 species, among which Juncus effusus was the most abundant. Fifty-seven percent of the species were also recorded in the aboveground vegetation, the dominant species being Rubus fruticosus agg., but only 28{\%} of the aboveground species were present in the seed bank. Our results suggest that (1) vernal geophytes and shade-tolerant perennials, which group most true forest species, are not incorporated in the seed bank, (2) parent plants of most seeds were present either in the stand in an earlier dynamic stage or apart from the stand and long-distance dispersed, (3) as expected, early-successional species are well represented in the seed bank, (4) forestry vehicles seem to be a major means of dispersion for stress-tolerant species normally found in forest lanes and wheel tracks. We conclude that seed banks contain species that have a potentially negative impact on the true forest flora and, thus, forest management should minimize soil disturbance and retain remnants of old-coppice woods to conserve disturbance-sensitive true forest species.},

	abstract = {Vegetation composition differs significantly between ancientand recent forest, due to slow colonization capacity of typical forest speciesand the higher abundance of early successional species in recent forest.However, little is known about differences in persistent seed bank compositionbetween ancient and recent forest and about the interaction between seed bankand vegetation in relation with forest age. We surveyed the seed bank and theunderstorey vegetationcomposition in transects from ancient to recent forest. Seed bank and fieldlayer vegetation characteristics and similarity between seed bank andvegetationwere analysed in relation to recent forest age and distance to the ancientforest. A total of 39 species and 14,911 seedlings germinated, whichcorresponds with a seed density of 12,426 seeds/m2.Total seed density is significantly higher in the youngest recent forest parcel(55 years). Also the seed bank composition in the youngest forest parceldifferssignificantly from the other parcels. After a longer period of reforestation,the seed bank approaches that of the ancient forest, suggesting seed bankdepletion, although the seed bank is permanently replenished to some extent byseed bank forming species from local disturbances. Seed bank composition doesnot change significantly with distance to the ancient forest. Similaritybetween seed bank and vegetation composition, nomatter the forest age, is very low, but decreases with increasing forest age.The most frequent species in the vegetation are absent in the seed bank andvice versa. The contribution of forest species is highin the vegetation and they almost not occur in the seed bank, while species offorest edges and clearings, and species of disturbed environments are morefrequent in the seed bank. The seed bank is mainly composed of earlysuccessional species of former forest stages or species which temporary occurinsmall-scale disturbances. The seed bank may enhance the negative effects ofearlysuccessional, mainly competitive species to the forest species richness in therecent forest. In this respect, forest management should minimise forestdisturbances, to prevent germination of competitive species form buriedseeds.},

	n2 = {Abstract The effects of fire on the vegetation vary across continents. However, in Neotropical fire-prone grasslands, the relationship between fire and seed germination is still poorly understood, while their regeneration, especially after strong anthropogenic disturbance, is challenging for their conservation. In the present study, we assessed diversity of germination strategies in 15 dominant herbaceous species from Neotropical altitudinal grasslands (locally known as campos rupestres). We exposed seeds to several fire-related treatments. We also compared germination between regularly and post-fire fruiting species. Finally, we investigated the diversity of dormancy classes aiming at better understanding the biogeography and phylogeny of seed dormancy. Germination strategies varied among families. Velloziaceae and Xyridaceae produced non-dormant, fast-germinating seeds. Cyperaceae and Poaceae showed an extremely low or null germination due to a high proportion of unviable or embryo-less seeds. The seeds of campo rupestre grasslands are fire resistant, but there is no evidence that fire triggers germination in this fire-prone ecosystem. Although heat and charred wood did not promote germination, smoke enhanced germination in one grass species and decreased the mean germination time and improved synchrony in Xyridaceae and Velloziaceae. Fire had a positive effect on post-fire regeneration by stimulating fruit set in some Cyperaceae and Poaceae species. These species produced faster germinating seeds with higher germination percentage and synchrony compared to regularly fruiting Cyperaceae and Poaceae species. This strategy of dispersion and regeneration seems to be an alternative to the production of seeds with germination triggered by fire. Physiological dormancy is reported for the first time in several clades of Neotropical plants. Our data help advance the knowledge on the role of fire in the regeneration of Neotropical grasslands.},

This model study examined the role of these three traits in relation to environmental disturbance. We chose temperate grasslands, widespread in north Western Europe and northern and eastern America, as our reference system for our simulations. Eight plant strategies were defined by allowing two levels in each of the three and combining them in all eight possible ways. A simple, spatially explicit model was developed to simulate competition among individuals with these eight trait combinations at different levels of disturbance. ?Simulation results were compared with the actual occurrence over a disturbance gradient of species with similar plant trait combinations in a large database from the Sheffield area (UK). This showed that with increasing disturbance level, non-dormant perennials, dormant perennials, non-dormant annuals and dormant annuals, respectively, became dominant but only if small-seeded, indicating the relative viability of these particular strategies with respect to disturbance. ?A new prediction from the model was that stable coexistence occurs between plant strategies with dormant and with non-dormant seeds over a range of levels of disturbance. Plant strategies with large seeds were inferior to small-seeded ones if competitive ability of seedlings is proportional to seed weight. This difference was highest at low seed densities and low germination probabilities, indicating that large-seeded species secure no advantage from being dormant (i.e. having a low germination probability). Finally, the results indicated that dormancy is superior to dispersal as a method of coping with disturbance.},

	abstract = {The movement of plant species across the globe exposes native communities to new species introductions. While introductions are pervasive, two aspects of variability underlie patterns and processes of biological invasions at macroecological scales. First, only a portion of introduced species become invaders capable of substantially impacting ecosystems. Second, species that do become invasive at one location may not be invasive in others; impacts depend on invader abundance and recipient species and conditions. Accounting for these phenomena is essential to accurately understand patterns of plant invasion and explain the idiosyncratic results reflected in the literature on biological invasions. The lack of community-level richness and abundance data spanning broad scales and environmental conditions has until now hindered our understanding of invasions at a macroecological scale. To address this limitation, we leveraged quantitative surveys of plant communities in the United States and integrated and harmonized nine datasets into the Standardized Plant Community with Introduced Status (SPCIS) database. The database contains 14,056 unique taxa identified within 83,391 sampling units, of which 52.6% have at least one introduced species. The SPCIS database includes comparable information of plant species occurrence, abundance and native status across the 50 U.S. states and Puerto Rico. SPCIS can be used to answer macro-scale questions about native plant communities and interactions with invasive plants.

	n2 = {Abstract Frost events during the active growth period of plants can cause extensive frost damage with tremendous economic losses and dramatic ecological consequences. A common assumption is that climate warming may bring along a reduction in the frequency and severity of frost damage to vegetation. On the other hand, it has been argued that rising temperature in late winter and early spring might trigger the so called ?false spring?, that is, early onset of growth that is followed by cold spells, resulting in increased frost damage. By combining daily gridded climate data and 1,489 k in situ phenological observations of 27 tree species from 5,565 phenological observation sites in Europe, we show here that temporal changes in the risk of spring frost damage with recent warming vary largely depending on the species and geographical locations. Species whose phenology was especially sensitive to climate warming tended to have increased risk of frost damage. Geographically, compared with continental areas, maritime and coastal areas in Europe were more exposed to increasing occurrence of frost and these late spring frosts were getting more severe in the maritime and coastal areas. Our results suggest that even though temperatures will be elevated in the future, some phenologically responsive species and many populations of a given species will paradoxically experience more frost damage in the future warming climate. More attention should be paid to the increased frost damage in responsive species and populations in maritime areas when developing strategies to mitigate the potential negative impacts of climate change on ecosystems in the near future.},

	abstract = {Biological invasions are the second most severe threat affecting biodiversity worldwide with major economic and societal impacts. Yet, the multitude of species with the potential to be invasive makes it extremely difficult to anticipate invasions to develop efficient management plans. Predicting which species are likely to become invaders and where they are likely to invade even before their introduction outside their native range has always been a prime objective of invasion biology. Based on the example of ants, we provide a profiling method to predict future invaders and future invasions, and in this manner, we identify 18 ant species likely to become new invaders and regions at risk for these invasions. Invasive alien species are a great threat to biodiversity and human livelihoods worldwide. The most effective way to limit their impacts and costs is to prevent their introduction into new areas. Identifying invaders and invasions before their occurrence would arguably be the most efficient strategy. Here, we provide a profiling method to predict which species---with which particular ecological characteristics---will invade, and where they could invade. We illustrate our approach with ants, which are among the most detrimental invasive species, as they are responsible for declines of numerous taxa, are involved in local extinctions, disturb ecosystem functioning, and impact multiple human activities. Based on statistical profiling of 992 ant species from an extensive trait database, we identify 18 native ant species with an ecological profile that matches that of known invasive ants. Even though they are not currently described as such, these species are likely to become the next global invaders. We couple these predictions with species distribution models to identify the regions most at risk from the invasion of these species: Northern and Central America, Brazil, Central Africa and Madagascar, Southeast Asia, Papua New Guinea Northeast Australia, and many islands worldwide. This framework, applicable to any other taxa, represents a remarkable opportunity to implement timely and specifically shaped proactive management strategies against biological invasions.},

Methods We assessed the effects of temperature on dormancy and germination of Viola grayi seeds and evaluated whether winter warming could affect its germination phenology by conducting germination experiments and analyzing soil temperature data in cold and warm winters. Results Viola grayi seeds were dormant when dispersed in spring. One-month moist-chilling treatment (4$\,^{\circ}$C) effectively released dormancy, while short, intermittent lower temperatures (alternating 20$\,^{\circ}$/5$\,^{\circ}$C) did not. Continuous higher temperatures induced secondary dormancy in nondormant seeds. During a cold, snowy winter, the surface soil temperatures of the sand dune remained at 0$\,^{\circ}$?2$\,^{\circ}$C for approximately 1 month owing to the accumulated snow, while the period of such stable low soil temperatures was much shorter during a warm, less-snowy winter, and the highest soil temperature reached 20$\,^{\circ}$?25$\,^{\circ}$C. These results suggest that dispersed seeds germinate in the following spring after winter chilling, but they may remain dormant after warm winters. Conclusions With winter warming, seed dormancy of V. grayi seeds could be prolonged and the associated germination delayed. Assessing the minimum requirements for dormancy release and the potential to form persistent soil seed banks is important for judging the necessity and urgency of conservation efforts for temperate dune species.},

We compared three temperature-related potential constraints across three study regions: (1) absolute minimum temperature within 100 years; (2) lowest temperatures during the period of bud-break; and (3) length and temperature of the growing season. Location Western and Eastern Swiss Alps (1165?2160 m a.s.l.) and southern Sweden (57$\,^{\circ}$N?59$\,^{\circ}$N). Methods In situ temperature was recorded at the high-elevation and high-latitude limits of seven broad-leaved tree species and correlated with temperatures at the nearest weather stations, in order to reconstruct the temperature regime for the past 50 years. By applying generalized extreme value distribution theory, we estimated the lowest temperatures recurring during the life span of a tree. Results At their high-elevation limits, five out of the seven tree species experienced winter minimum temperatures considerably warmer than their known maximum freezing resistance in winter. For the bud-break period, potentially damaging temperatures occurred at both the elevational and the latitudinal limits and for all four species for which phenological data were available. Three out of five species for which a latitudinal replicate was available showed a similar length of growing season at their respective elevational and latitudinal limits. The mean temperature during the growing season was always warmer at a species? latitudinal limit than at its elevational limit, and hence this variable does not bear general explanatory power for the range limit. Main conclusions Low-temperature extremes during bud-break are the most likely candidates for controlling the elevational and latitudinal limits of broad-leaved tree species. The absolute minimum temperature in winter and the mean temperature during the growing season are unlikely to constrain the cold limits of these species. Thus, the results call for the use of temperature data (extremes) during key stages of spring phenology when attempting to explain the low-temperature range limits and to predict the potential range shifts of deciduous tree species.},

	n2 = {Summary Spring ephemeral herb species in temperate deciduous forests are active above-ground only briefly each year. This study tested experimentally how two countervailing constraints ? cold and darkness ? influence the phenology of six spring herb species. Dormancy of underground structures, maintained by cold temperatures in a growth chamber, was broken at six 25-day intervals from January or February to June in two consecutive years. Upon emergence, survival and flowering were measured on cohorts grown outdoors. Shade cloth was added at the time of normal canopy closure. Cardamine concatenata, Dicentra cucullaria, Erythronium albidum and Trillium recurvatum had no or low 2-year survival in the two or three earliest cohorts and no or low survival in the latest cohort, relative to their natural cohort. Allium canadense and Claytonia virginica had survival in all cohorts. Flowering never occurred in the first two or three cohorts for three species and never occurred or declined in later cohorts in all species. Despite widely differing emergence dates, senescence was completed within a 40-day period soon after shade was imposed for all cohorts for all species. Consequently, leaf life span became shorter as date of emergence was delayed among cohorts. In general, the brief growth period of spring herb species is an adaptation to avoid winter cold and late-spring canopy shade. These constraints are species-specific and differ for survival and flowering for some species. Claytonia virginica is the most tolerant among the species to a wider range of conditions. Synthesis. Knowing that cold and shade constrain a plant's non-dormant period is important because of the significant role plant phenology plays in responses to climate change.},

@article{Chesson:2003ve,
	abstract = {Temporal fluctuations in recruitment are involved in two distinct coexistence mechanisms, the storage effect and relative nonlinearity of competition, which may act simultaneously to stabilize species coexistence. It is shown that comparisons of recruitment variation between species at high versus low densities can test whether these mechanisms are responsible for stable coexistence. Moreover, under certain circumstances, these comparisons can measure the total coexistence stabilizing effect of the mechanism. These comparisons are clearest for the situation of an invader (a species perturbed to low density) in the presence of its competitors, termed residents. Then average invader--resident differences in the variances of log recruitment, potentially weighted by adult survival rates and species'sensitivities to competition, are proportional to the overall stabilizing effect of the storage effect and relative nonlinearity of competition. Less effective comparisons are available for species naturally at high and low densities or with substantial mean differences in average fitness. These developments lead also to a technique of partitioning the long-term low-density growth rate of a species into community average measures of stabilizing mechanisms, deviations from these measures, and other factors. The community average measure is argued as most appropriate for understanding the ability of a coexistence mechanism to stabilize coexistence. Individual species'deviations from the community average indicate the ways in a which a coexistence mechanism may affect average fitness differences between species either enhancing or diminishing the ability of a given set of species to coexist, depending on other factors. This approach provides a general new tool for analyzing species coexistence.},

If priority effects are detected, are these exerted via niche preemption or niche modification mechanisms? Are the resulting patterns of species establishment related to differences in functional trait composition? Location Meerdaal forest, Oud‐Heverlee, Belgium. Methods A 2‐yr field experiment on a topsoil‐stripped site of 8.5 ha was carried out. We manipulated the early arrival of dominant and subordinate species. The `dominant species' set consisted of three generalist grass species, and the `subordinate species' set consisted of nine species of forbs and graminoids that often occur in nutrient‐poor grasslands. After 4 wk, we sowed nine target species for ecological restoration. We recorded plant species cover during 2 yr. We used repeated measures ANOVA to test for effects of time (2013, 2014) and treatment (dominant, subordinate and control) on plant species richness, evenness, cover, functional diversity and species and trait composition dissimilarity. Results Both dominant and subordinate species successfully suppressed undesirable early colonizing species. Dominants did not exert priority effects on target species. However, subordinate species exerted strong priority effects via niche preemption, and suppressed their establishment of target species. Conclusions Manipulating the arrival order of dominant species has potential as a restoration tool that can allow restoration practitioners to enhance the establishment success of target species for restoration. We suggest that seed mixtures for restoration should contain dominant species, because they will not affect the establishment of subordinate (target) species, but will impede the establishment of unwanted pioneer and ruderal species. We also demonstrate that implementing trait‐based measures in restoration projects can help to adequately predict assembly processes.

@article{Vaughn:2015wp,
	abstract = {{$[$}Temporal priority can affect individual performance and reproduction, as well as community assembly, but whether these effects persist over time remains unclear, and their demographic mechanisms have been little explored. The continued dominance of exotic annual grasses in California has been commonly attributed to their demonstrated early germination and rapid early growth relative to native perennial grasses. This advantage may play a crucial role in the structure of California exotic annual grasslands, as well as in the practice of native grassland restoration. We tested whether a two-week planting advantage under field conditions increased individual survival, growth, and reproduction for four native perennial grass species and whether these effects persisted over three years. We show that short-term priority significantly increased the establishment success of native perennial grasses. Increased density of native grass seedlings presaged later large increases in cover that were not evident in the first year after planting. Although priority effects at the individual level may diminish over time, short differences in emergence timing can have long-lasting effects on community structure. Earlier germination and faster initial growth of exotic annual species may help explain their unprecedented invasion and continued dominance of California grasslands. Finally, these results highlight the importance of priority effects for effective exotic annual control during native grassland restoration in California: initial control can increase the establishment of native perennial seedlings, which then results in long-term control by mature native individuals.{$]$}},

Summary Due to their peculiar characteristics, seed germination and emergence assays may pose problems for data analysis, due to non-normal error distribution and serial correlation between the numbers of seeds counted on different dates from the same experimental unit (Petri dish, pot, plot). Furthermore, it is necessary to consider viable seeds that have not germinated/emerged at the end of an experiment (censored observations), as well as late germination/emergence flushes, that relate to genotypic differences within natural occurring seed populations. Traditional methods of data analysis may not be optimal for dealing with these problems. Therefore, survival analysis may represent an appropriate alternative. In this analysis, the time course of germination/emergence is described by using a non-parametric step function (?germination function?) and the effect of factors and covariates on ?germination functions? is assessed by Accelerated Failure Time regression and expressed in terms of ?time ratios?. These parameters measure how a change in the explanatory variables changes (prolongs/shortens) the time to germination of a seed lot. This paper presents four examples of the application of survival analysis on seed germination/emergence studies. Results are discussed and compared with those obtained with more traditional techniques.},

We investigated whether robustness or plasticity in response to environmental cues were more commonly exhibited by exotic than native species during germination, evidenced by (1) exhibiting consistently greater germination rate under a variety of conditions (robustness), or (2) increasing germination rate more strongly than native species in response to favorable conditions (plasticity). We conducted growth chamber germination trials of 12 native and 12 exotic species common to coastal sage scrub, a shrub-dominated Mediterranean-type ecosystem in California. Time to germination and percentage germination were recorded in response to variation in three environmental cues: temperature, day length, and soil moisture. Exotic species, especially annuals, displayed consistently higher germination percentages and more rapid germination than native species. Exotic germination percentages also responded more strongly when conditions were favorable (warm temperatures and high soil moisture), and germinated earlier than natives when conditions were indicative of typical growing season conditions in Mediterranean ecosystems (short day length and cool temperatures). Exotic species had more rapid and prolific germination across a variety of environmental cues and in response to increased resource availability compared with native species, indicating both germination plasticity and robustness. These traits may enable colonization of novel environments, particularly if they allow exotic species to establish earlier in the growing season than native species, setting the stage for seasonal priority effects.},

Regression quantitatively describes the relationship between a response variable and one or more continuous independent variables, while ANOVA determines whether a response variable differs among discrete values of the independent variable(s). Designing experiments with discrete factors is straightforward because ANOVA is the only option, but what is the best way to design experiments involving continuous factors? Should ecologists prefer experiments with few treatments and many replicates analyzed with ANOVA, or experiments with many treatments and few replicates per treatment analyzed with regression? We recommend that ecologists choose regression, especially replicated regression, over ANOVA when dealing with continuous factors for two reasons: (1) regression is generally a more powerful approach than ANOVA and (2) regression provides quantitative output that can be incorporated into ecological models more effectively than ANOVA output.},

	abstract = {Cryptotaenia canadensis is an herbaceous species of mesic and wet mesic forests and floodplains of eastern North America. The peak of flowering is in late May, and seeds ripen in late August and early September. Seeds have underdeveloped embryos and require cold stratification to come out of dormancy; thus, they have deep morphophysiological dormancy (MPD). In a nonheated greenhouse embryo length increased more than 85{\%} (from 1.6-3.0 mm) during winter, and seeds germinated from early March to late April. Plants do not require vernalization for flowering, and in the greenhouse they can flower within 10 weeks after germination in spring. Thus, plants have the potential to behave as summer annuals. In the field, however, flowering is delayed until the 2nd year, or later. Vegetative propagation in C. canadensis occurs by the production of offshoots (ramets) at the base of the stem. The ramets are monocarpic. Ramet buds are formed during early May, but they do not produce leaves and roots until late August and early September. Many ramets behave as winter annuals, growing during autumn, overwintering, and then growing, flowering, setting seeds and dying the following growing season. Any ramets that fail to reach the critical size for flowering remain vegetative throughout the growing season and survive to the next growing season.},

However, {$<$} 10{\%} of seeds germinated at or below 20/10 C, with lower germination in the presence of light than in darkness.

After 1 yr of dry storage (after-ripening), germination exceeded 94{\%} and did not differ significantly among temperature regimes. Germination exceeded 60{\%} in solutions with pH 3 to 10. Germination was reduced below 50{\%} in solutions with osmotic potentials below −0.6 MPa. Percent emergence was greater than 56{\%} at burial depths in soil of 0 to 5 cm, with maximal emergence (93 to 99{\%}) at 0 to 2 cm.

In desert ecosystems of the southwestern USA, the forbs Brassica tournefortii, Erodium cicutarium and Schismus spp. dominate and alter native annual communities. Hand weeding B. tournefortii is currently the most common control method employed, but weeding is inadequate and expensive for managing large-scale invasions. New methods must be developed to conserve and restore desert ecosystems. 2.?Exotic annuals in desert systems have rapid germination and phenology compared to natives, indicating that a window for selective control of exotic annuals may occur immediately after exotic seedling emergence. We tested the role of timing in control methods by comparing a cotyledon-stage glyphosate application to a bolting-stage application and to hand weeding B. tournefortii, plus an untreated check. Treatments were tested at two sites dominated by either exotic or native annuals and followed for 2?years; early application was repeated the second year. Cover and richness were evaluated during seedling and peak flowering stages underneath and between shrubs. 3.?Early glyphosate application did not affect native cover, but did reduce exotic cover. Late herbicide negatively impacted both exotics and natives. Natives had little positive response, and then only through hand weeding under shrubs, but the same treatment caused an increase in the exotic E. cicutarium. 4. Synthesis and applications.?The rapid phenology of exotic annuals may be exploited to control exotics while minimizing impacts on native plants in desert communities. This approach may be useful for other invasions in other ecosystems by species with rapid, early germination, or may act as a supplement to improve the efficacy of existing management regimes.},

The unique properties of seeds, particularly their tolerance to desiccation, their mobility, and their ability to schedule their germination to coincide with times when environmental conditions are favorable to their survival as seedlings, have no doubt contributed significantly to the success of seed-bearing plants. Humans are also dependent upon seeds, which constitute the majority of the world's staple foods (e.g., cereals and legumes). Seeds are an excellent system for studying fundamental developmental processes in plant biology, as they develop from a single fertilized zygote into an embryo and endosperm, in association with the surrounding maternal tissues. As genetic and molecular approaches have become increasingly powerful tools for biological research, seeds have become an attractive system in which to study a wide array of metabolic processes and regulatory systems. Seed Development, Dormancy and Germination provides a comprehensive overview of seed biology from the point of view of the developmental and regulatory processes that are involved in the transition from a developing seed through dormancy and into germination and seedling growth. It examines the complexity of the environmental, physiological, molecular and genetic interactions that occur through the life cycle of seeds, along with the concepts and approaches used to analyze seed dormancy and germination behavior. It also identifies the current challenges and remaining questions for future research. The book is directed at plant developmental biologists, geneticists, plant breeders, seed biologists and graduate students."--NHBS Environment Bookstore.},

To understand the role of reproductive traits in successful invasion of the species, we studied several traits of its reproductive system: the miniature capitulum and gynomonoecious sexual system, the biology and phenology of capitula and florets, pollen/ovule ratio, the mating system (self-compatibility), flower visitors, physical traits and dispersal potential of achenes, germination potential of achenes from manually pollinated capitula, and the association of these traits with invasiveness. Our study showed that the reproductive traits of autonomous seed production, versatile mating system of self- and cross-pollination, and generalized pollination system might contribute to the species? successful invasive capability. The invasiveness was further enhanced by the high and rapid production of achenes, as well as the high percentage, rapid germination rate and high dispersal capability of achenes. It was concluded that in annual or winter-annual weeds, autonomous seed production contributed significantly to the invasiveness of the species.},

An experiment with synthesized grassland communities was performed to identify plant traits that contribute to invasiveness and community traits that promote invasibility, and to study the relationship between, and the relative importance of, invasiveness and invasibility. ? ? Eight perennial grass species were used both as invasible monocultures and as potential invaders in gaps in these monocultures. Invasion success in the establishment phase, and invader and monoculture traits were assessed. ? ? Invasion success expressed as germination correlated significantly with germination time (invader trait), light penetration in the gaps and N acquisition by the edge plants (monoculture traits). Success expressed as leaf length correlated with seed mass, germination time (invader traits) and light penetration. Forty-six per cent of the variation in germination was explained by invader identity and 8{\%} by monoculture identity, whereas, for leaf length, they explained 15{\%} and 18{\%}, respectively. ? ? Regenerative traits (seed mass and germination time) correlated with invasiveness, and resource availability (light and nitrogen) with invasibility. The results suggest that species characteristics would largely determine the extent of an invasion event (number of seedlings), while the success of individual invaders (growth and survival) is determined by both species and ecosystem characteristics.},

	abstract = {\&{\#}x2022; Background and Aims This study examined the adaptive association between seed germination ecology and specialization to either forest or open habitats across a range of evolutionary lineages of seed plants, in order to test the hypotheses that (1) species' specialization to open vs. shaded habitats is consistently accompanied by specialization in their regeneration niche; and (2) species are thereby adapted to utilize different windows of opportunity in time (season) and space (habitat). \&{\#}x2022; Methods Seed germination response to temperature, light and stratification was tested for 17 congeneric pairs, each consisting of one forest species and one open-habitat species. A factorial design was used with temperature levels and diurnal temperature variation (10 \&{\#}xb0;C constant, 15-5 \&{\#}xb0;C fluctuating, 20 \&{\#}xb0;C constant, 25-15 \&{\#}xb0;C fluctuating), and two light levels (light and darkness) and a cold stratification treatment. The congeneric species pair design took phylogenetic dependence into account. \&{\#}x2022; Key Results Species from open habitats germinated better at high temperatures, whereas forest species performed equally well at low and high temperatures. Forest species tended to germinate only after a period of cold stratification that could break dormancy, while species from open habitats generally germinated without cold stratification. The empirically derived germination strategies correspond quite well with establishment opportunities for forest and open-habitat plant species in nature. \&{\#}x2022; Conclusions Annual changes in temperature and light regime in temperate forest delimit windows of opportunity for germination and establishment. Germination strategies of forest plants are adaptations to utilize such narrow windows in time. Conversely, lack of fit between germination ecology and environment may explain why species of open habitats generally fail to establish in forests. Germination strategy should be considered an important mechanism for habitat specialization in temperate herbs to forest habitats. The findings strongly suggest that phases in the plant life cycle other than the established phase should be considered important in adaptive specialization.},

	abstract = {Many anthropic activities generate soil disturbances, favoring competitive, fast growing invasive plant species at the expense of natives. Active restoration of invasion-resistant plant communities is increasingly recognized as a relevant strategy to combat invasive plant colonization in disturbed areas, but results are often unsatisfying. Historical effects, referred as ``priority effects''(i.e. the effects generated by the order in which species arrive at a local site), can have a major role in community assembly and invasion success because they involve early colonists altering the performance of later colonists. Taking these priority effects into account in restoration projects is emerging as a relevant way to improve native species restoration success and prevent invasion. The present review discusses two strategies considering priority effects that would help to achieve the classic restoration goal of ``more natives, less invasives''. The first strategy relies on tackling priority effects of invasive plants using different management options adapted to local environmental conditions, including removal, reduction of propagule sources, or mitigation of soil legacies. Indeed, invasive plants often generate strong priority effects providing themselves a substantial competitive advantage through early emergence and quick growth, but also self-induced soil modifications that can persist after their removal or death, commonly termed ``soil legacies''. In fertile and stable conditions, the reduction of invasive species priority effects must be coupled with the restoration of an invasion-resistant native plant cover to avoid reinvasion and secondary invasions. The second strategy is to bring about situations in which the restored native species are more likely to exert strong priority effects, decreasing invasion success. For this purpose, we sketch possible options open to restorationists based on resource or non-resource mechanisms. First, we discuss ways to maximize resource preemption by extending the time advance given to restored native species and manipulating restored species characteristics. Second, we consider the potential effect of increasing niche overlap between native and invasive species. Third, we introduce the potential manipulations of non-resource mechanisms, such as allelopathy, herbivory, disease, or the presence of mycorrhizae, to increase priority effects. This review incorporates recent research on priority effects to draw the outlines of priority effects-based restoration strategies and define future research questions that need to be addressed to test and improve these strategies.},

	abstract = {Forest light availability strongly regulates understory community composition, and low availability may confer resistance to invasion by exotic species, yet common buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica L.) invades North American temperate forests with a broad range of light habitats. It is unclear to what extent buckthorn's success is due to high mid-season shade tolerance versus shade avoidance permitted by early leaf out and late senescence. We used buckthorn seedlings planted into a forest diversity experiment in Cloquet, Minnesota, USA and a combined buckthorn physiology-canopy light model to test (1) how buckthorn germination, growth, and survival depend on canopy shading and (2) how canopy species richness and phenology affect light availability and buckthorn performance. Based on the mean of May, August, and October light measurements, we found that canopies that permitted ≤3{\%} transmission of incoming light had almost complete mortality of buckthorn and that growth of surviving buckthorn was strongly tied to light availability, but not canopy richness. Compared to deciduous canopies or deciduous-evergreen mixtures, evergreen canopies restricted light availability the most and led to the smallest and least likely to survive buckthorn. Our canopy models further indicated a tight linkage between buckthorn performance and spring and autumn light availability, but not summer light availability. We conclude that spring and autumn light availability are key regulators of buckthorn performance and that buckthorn relies on shade avoidance via an extended phenology to succeed in temperate forests. Consequently, we suggest species with extended spring or autumn canopy cover offer the greatest resistance to invasion, and communities which are often leafless during such periods are most vulnerable to invasion by buckthorn and similar invasive shrubs.},

Communities are predicted to resist invasion when they contain native species that are functionally similar to potential invaders; where phenology may be a key functional trait. Nutrient reduction is another common strategy for reducing invasion following native species restoration, because soil nitrogen (N) enrichment often facilitates invasion. Here, we focus on restoring the herbaceous community associated with coastal sage scrub vegetation in Southern California; these communities are often highly invaded, especially by exotic annual grasses that are notoriously challenging for restoration. We created experimental plant communities composed of the same 20 native species, but manipulated functional group abundance (according to growth form, phenology, and N-fixation capacity) and soil N availability. We fertilized to increase N, and added carbon to reduce N via microbial N immobilization. We found that N reduction decreased exotic cover, and the most successful seed mix for reducing exotic abundance varied depending on the invader functional type. For instance, exotic annual grasses were least abundant when the native community was dominated by early active forbs, which matched the phenology of the exotic annual grasses. Our findings show that nutrient availability and the timing of biotic interactions are key filters that can be manipulated in restoration to prevent invasion and maximize native species recovery.},

This observation indicates that extended phenology may be an important invasion mechanism for this system. However, most evidence that extended leaf phenology drives species invasion is anecdotal, and most studies that directly address the role of leaf phenology in invasion focus solely on increased invader growth. Beyond increasing invader growth, extended leaf phenology may drive invader impact on natives by (1) facilitating resource competition through nutrient pre-emption and shading, (2) altering production of secondary chemicals by invasive plants, (3) altering apparent competition dynamics mediated by native herbivores, (4) allowing temporal enemy escape, and (5) altering behaviour of native pollinators. I review current evidence from the literature regarding each of these possible consequences of extended invader phenology and emphasize the need for experimental manipulations to measure the extent to which extended leaf phenology mediates impact on the native community. Understanding the importance of leaf phenology in species invasion will facilitate prevention of future invasions while elucidating the role of seasonality in shaping species interactions.},

Shifts toward longer growing seasons, tracked by plant and animal species worldwide, heighten the need for this analysis. The concurrent availability of extensive citizen-science and long-term datasets has created tremendous opportunities to test the relationship between phenology and invasion. Here, we (1) extend major theories within community and invasion biology to include phenology, (2) develop a predictive framework to test these theories, and (3) outline available data resources to test predictions. By creating an integrated framework, we show how new analyses of long-term datasets could advance the fields of community ecology and invasion biology, while developing novel strategies for invasive species management.

	abstract = {The germination behavior of a plant influences its fitness, persistence, and evolutionary potential, as well as its biotic environment. This can have major effects on the invasive potential of a species. We review the findings of four types of experimental studies comparing basic germination characteristics of invasive versus non-invasive congeners, in their non-native or native distribution range; invasive alien versus native species; and invasive species in their native versus non-native distribution range. Early and/or rapid germination is typical of invasive species rather than their non-invasive congeners, and represents a pre-adaptation from which many invasive and naturalized species benefit. It also occurs more often in invasive than native species, suggesting that competition mitigation or avoidance in the early stages of a plant's life, via the exploitation of vacant germination niches, might be more useful than a superior competitive ability in novel environments. This is further supported by a tendency of invasive species to germinate earlier and/or faster and have broader germination cues in their non-native than in their native range. It is also supported by broader germination requirements being reported for invasive species than their non-invasive or native congeners. In contrast, high percentage germination is not a consistent predictor of invasiveness, suggesting that the incorporation of a larger fraction of seed production into the soil seed bank rather than high germination is a better (or safer) strategy in novel environments. These patterns indicate that differences in the germination behavior of alien and native species contribute to the invasiveness of many species, although evidence under natural conditions is needed. The role of such differences in the establishment and spread of invasive species in novel environments and their long-term impact on community dynamics requires further study.},

@article{Cleland2015,
	abstract = {{Exotic species are sometimes phenologically distinct from native species
   in the invaded community, allowing them to be active when there may be
   reduced competition for resources. In southern California, annual
   species are particularly problematic invaders, and prior work has shown
   that these species germinate earlier in the growing season, giving them
   a competitive advantage over later-germinating native species. This
   result begs the question, if being active earlier is advantageous, why
   have not native species adapted earlier cues for germination? We
   hypothesized native species would benefit less from earlier germination
   than exotic species (potentially due to slower growth following
   germination), thus negating potential selection for early germination.
   Here we manipulated planting time for common native and exotic species,
   growing them in all possible species pairs, to evaluate how competitive
   outcomes were altered by the time of arrival and the origin of competing
   species. In contrast to our hypotheses, the exotic species often had
   lower biomass when planted first, potentially due to disturbance when
   the second species was planted. In contrast, three out of our four
   native species benefited from earlier planting (a priority effect).
   Unlike the potential benefit of arriving early, we found no evidence
   that being planted one week later resulted in a competitive
   disadvantage, when compared to being planted simultaneously with a
   competitor. Further, we found that the magnitude and even direction of
   priority effects varied depending on the identity of the interacting
   species. Together these results suggest that a lack of directional
   selection may prevent adaptation towards earlier germination times of
   native species. Although this experiment was conducted with a limited
   suite of species, the results show that the role of seasonal priority
   effects varies among species, and that native species could benefit from
   seasonal priority effects in restoration efforts even when in
   competition with fast-growing exotic annual species.}},

	abstract = {{Competition is an important interaction in ecology, and many experiments
   have been done to examine the effects of intraspecific and interspecific
   competition. Unfortunately, most of these experiments have been done
   using either substitution or additive experimental designs. Substitution
   designs, and to a lesser extent additive designs, severely limit the
   useful inferences that ecologists can draw from the resulting data.
   Response surface experimental designs, which vary the densities of two
   competing species independently, offer the advantage of being able to
   compare the fits of alternative competition models and to estimate model
   parameters. This kind of experimental design has been relatively little
   used in ecology to date. I consider the use of response surface designs
   from two perspectives. The first is the optimal allocation of
   experimental effort among density treatments, with the goal of
   distinguishing among alternative models. Second, I compare the ability
   of six response surface designs to estimate known competition
   coefficients correctly, using simulated data. Low densities and
   densities near equilibrium in one generation tend to return similar
   densities the following generation and thus provide little or no
   information for comparing alternative population models. Experimental
   designs that span a wide range of densities, including high densities
   above carrying capacities, provide more accurate parameter estimates in
   general, but low densities are helpful for estimating population growth
   rates. Designs that are not fully factorial are one compromise solution

Mean time to germination (MGT) is a measure of the rate and time-spread of germination; however, there is a problem with using this method to calculate germination rate. MGT does not show the time from the start of imbibition to a specific germination percentage. MGT has been used to compare specific pairs or groups of means and to evaluate seed vigour. However, it is not the real time to mean germination but just an index of germination speed. Using MGT is not correct for ANOVA, post-ANOVA or the other comparison tests, because it does not show time to a specific germination percentage. Thus, we recommend that t50 be used instead of MGT. The t50 has all benefits of MGT, but it does not have the problems of MGT in treatment comparisons.},

However, many species produce nondormant seeds, particularly in wet tropical forests, a biogeographic pattern that is not well accounted for in current models. We hypothesized that the global distribution of dormant seeds derives from their adaptive value in predictably fluctuating (i.e. seasonal) environments. However, the advantage conferred by dormancy might ultimately depend on other seed attributes, particularly size. This general model was tested within a phylogenetically informed framework using a data set comprising > 216 000 world-wide observations of Fabaceae, spanning three orders of magnitude in seed size and including both dormant and nondormant seeds. Our results confirmed our hypothesis: nondormant seeds can only evolve in climates with long growing seasons and/or in lineages that produce larger seeds. Conversely, dormancy should be evolutionarily stable in temperate lineages with small seeds. When the favorable season is fleeting, seed dormancy is the only adaptive strategy. Based on these results, we predict that, within a given lineage, taxa producing larger, nondormant seeds will necessarily predominate in aseasonal environments, while plants bearing small, dormant seeds will be dominant under short growing seasons.},

However, the regenerative traits of seed dormancy and germination are underrepresented in this context. In the alpine zone, the large species and microhabitat diversity provide an ideal context to assess habitat-related regenerative strategies. To this end, seeds of 53 species growing in alpine siliceous and calcareous habitats (6230 and 6170 of EU Directive 92/43, respectively) were exposed to different temperature treatments under controlled laboratory conditions. Germination strategies in each habitat were identified by clustering with k-means. Then, phylogenetic least squares correlations (PGLS) were fitted to assess germination and dormancy differences between species? main habitat (calcareous and siliceous), microhabitat (grasslands, heaths, rocky, and species with no specific microhabitats), and chorology (arctic?alpine and continental). Calcareous and siliceous grasslands significantly differ in their germination behaviour with a slow, mostly overwinter germination and high germination under all conditions, respectively. Species with high overwinter germination occurs mostly in heaths and have an arctic?alpine distribution. Meanwhile, species with low or high germinability in general inhabit in grasslands or have no specific microhabitat (they belong to generalist), respectively. Alpine species use different germination strategies depending on habitat provenance, species? main microhabitat, and chorotype. Such differences may reflect adaptations to local environmental conditions and highlight the functional role of germination and dormancy in community ecology.},

Despite the clear implications of priority effects for ecological restoration, there have been no reviews of how and where priority effects have been studied and the extent to which findings can be applied to restoration. Here, we systematically review the literature on priority effects by (1) synthesizing information from papers that compared simultaneous and nonsimultaneous planting or sowing; (2) discussing the mechanisms through which priority effects operate, (3) considering how these mechanisms might be manipulated to achieve restoration goals; and (4) highlighting future research needed to improve the use of priority effects in restoration. In a term-targeted search, we found 43 studies that experimentally manipulated the order of arrival of different species. Overall, these concluded that even small delays in arrival time, as opposed to simultaneous arrival of species, can promote differences in subsequent community composition as well as ecosystem functions. There were very few studies on the long-term stability of these priority effects, and the majority were conducted in temperate grasslands. Our findings suggest that creating alternative vegetation states via priority treatments is a promising avenue for restoration. However, for the concept to be best operationalized for restoration, we need research in more ecosystems that are priorities for restoration, and treatments that are followed over extended time periods.},

Using experiments and simulations, we show that both mechanisms consistently affect coexistence and that, contrary to long-held assumptions, the effect of relative nonlinearity can be larger in magnitude. These results may be general in that the simultaneous emergence of both mechanisms rests on two factors common to nearly all ecological systems, from the human gut to the soil microbiome: variable environmental conditions and saturating population growth rates.Understanding the origins and maintenance of biodiversity remains one of biology's grand challenges. From theory and observational evidence, we know that variability in environmental conditions through time is likely critical to the coexistence of competing species. Nevertheless, experimental tests of fluctuation-driven coexistence are rare and have typically focused on just one of two potential mechanisms, the temporal storage effect, to the neglect of the theoretically equally plausible mechanism known as relative nonlinearity of competition. We combined experiments and simulations in a system of nectar yeasts to quantify the relative contribution of the two mechanisms to coexistence. Resource competition models parameterized from single-species assays predicted the outcomes of mixed-culture competition experiments with 83{\%} accuracy. Model simulations revealed that both mechanisms have measurable effects on coexistence and that relative nonlinearity can be equal or greater in magnitude to the temporal storage effect. In addition, we show that their effect on coexistence can be both antagonistic and complementary. These results falsify the common assumption that relative nonlinearity is of negligible importance, and in doing so reveal the importance of testing coexistence mechanisms in combination.},

The spatial storage effect promotes coexistence when (1) species have unique vital rate responses to their spatial environment and, when abundant, (2) experience stronger competition in the environmental patches where they perform better. In a naturally occurring southwest Western Australian annual plant system, we conducted a neighbor removal experiment involving eleven focal species growing in high-abundance populations. Specifically, we measured species? fecundity across a variety of environmental gradients in both the presence and absence of neighbors. For the environmental variables that we measured, there was only limited evidence for species-specific responses to the environment, with a composite variable describing overstory cover and leaf litter cover being the best predictor of fecundity for a subset of focal species. In addition, although we found strong evidence for intraspecific competition, positive environment?competition covariance was only detected for one species. Thus, positive environment?competition covariance may not be as common as expected in populations of species growing at high abundance, at least when tested in natural assemblages. Our findings highlight the inherent limitations of using natural assemblages to study spatial coexistence mechanisms, and we urge empirical ecologists to take these limitations into account when designing future experiments.},

An emerging literature on priority effects suggests the manipulation of community assembly as a useful technique to help overcome these difficulties by altering competitive relationships. We present data from a set of four priority experiments, carried out at each of three sites in restoration settings in California grasslands. These data, combined with patterns summarized from the literature, indicate that both short-term priority (1?3 weeks) and long-term priority (1 year) can profoundly shift interspecific relationships and benefit otherwise subordinate plant species, but that these effects are sometimes transitory, asymmetric, and contingent on environmental conditions and species composition. Restoration interventions that can produce priority effects include staggered planting times, weed control, seed pre-germination, plug planting, and spatial aggregation. Such interventions are likely to be at least initially effective, but their strength and persistence can differ considerably across systems in space and time. Further research may help identify the conditions that maximize the strength and persistence of priority effects in restoration settings.},

Several dormancy types may be found in a given habitat, and narrowly endemic and widely-distributed species in the same genus may have similar germination characteristics.

	n2 = {Abstract Shifts in the phenologies of coexistence species are altering the temporal structure of natural communities worldwide. However, predicting how these changes affect the structure and long-term dynamics of natural communities is challenging because phenology and coexistence theory have largely proceeded independently. Here, I propose a conceptual framework that incorporates seasonal timing of species interactions into a well-studied competition model to examine how changes in phenologies influence long-term dynamics of natural communities. Using this framework I demonstrate that persistence and coexistence conditions strongly depend on the difference in species? mean phenologies and how this difference varies across years. Consequently, shifts in mean and interannual variation in relative phenologies of species can fundamentally alter the outcome of interactions and the potential for persistence and coexistence of competing species. These effects can be predicted by how per-capita effects scale with differences in species? phenologies. I outline how this approach can be parameterized with empirical systems and discuss how it fits within the context of current coexistence theory. Overall, this synthesis reveals that phenology of species interactions can play a crucial yet currently understudied role in driving coexistence and biodiversity patterns in natural systems and determine how species will respond to future climate change.},

	abstract = {{A model for simulating Polygonum aviculare L. seed dormancy loss in
   relation to stratification temperature was developed. The model employs
   the lower limit temperature for germination (T-l) as an index of seed
   population dormancy status. While population mean for T-l (T-l(50)) and
   T-l distribution within the population (sigma(Tl)) are allowed to vary
   as seeds are released from dormancy, other thermal parameters
   characterizing the germination thermal responses (base, optimal and
   maximal temperatures, and thermal time required for germination) and the
   higher limit temperature for germination (T-h) are held constant. In
   order to relate changes in T-l(50) and sigma(Tl) to variable time and
   temperature, a stratification thermal time index (S-tt) was developed,
   which consists of the accumulation of thermal time units under a
   threshold temperature for dormancy loss to occur. Therefore, T-l(50) and
   sigma(Tl) varied in relation to the accumulation of S-tt according to
   time and temperature. To derive model equations, changes in seed
   population thermal parameters were estimated for buried seeds stored at
   1.6, 7 and 12degreesC for 110 d. Seeds were exhumed at regular
   intervals, and were incubated at 15degreesC and at a gradually
   increasing temperature regime in the range 6-25degreesC. The germination
   time-course curves obtained were reproduced using a mathematical model.
   Thermal parameters that best fit simulated and experimentally obtained
   germination time-course curves were determined. Model performance was
   evaluated against data of two unrelated experiments, showing acceptable
   prediction of timing and percentage of germination of seeds exhumed from
   field and controlled temperature conditions.}},

	abstract = {{P>Mathematical models that predict emergence of weed seedbanks could be
   useful tools for determining the most suitable time for weed seedling
   control and, consequently, should result in a higher efficacy of applied
   control methods. To achieve this goal in dormant weed species,
   functional relationships should be established between environmental
   factors regulating dormancy and dormancy changes of seed populations. In
   the present work, we used a simple model and an optimisation procedure
   to quantify the effect of temperature on Polygonum aviculare seed
   dormancy release and induction, based on germination data. Dormancy
   release rate was inversely related to temperature, showing a decreasing
   logistic trend that results in no dormancy release for seeds exposed to
   20 and 25 degrees C. In contrast, dormancy induction rates in absolute
   values were positively associated with temperature, showing a logistic
   trend in which dormancy induction was almost zero at low temperatures
   and maximal at 25 degrees C. Derived model parameters were used to
   simulate dormancy changes of P. aviculare seeds stored under controlled
   and field conditions. These results suggest that similar model
   structures could be used to quantify temperature effects on seed
   dormancy status of other weed species and to develop predictive models

	abstract = {{Temperature is a key factor affecting both dormancy and germination. In
   non-dormant seeds, when temperature is within the thermal range
   permissive for germination, it just regulates germination velocity,
   while in seeds presenting dormancy it can also be affecting dormancy
   level, dormancy termination and the expression of dormancy itself. This
   dual effect of temperature on dormancy and germination often leads to
   misinterpretation of obtained germination results and confounds the
   analysis of temperature effects in seed populations presenting some
   degree of dormancy. In the present paper we discuss the effect of
   temperature in the regulation of dormancy level and its implications in
   dormancy expression, as an attempt to construct a conceptual framework
   that allows distinguishing between the effects of temperature on
   dormancy and germination. Finally, we present examples of how a better
   understanding of these effects could help us to interpret the mixed
   effects of temperature on both processes during incubation of seeds
   presenting dormancy.}},

	abstract = {Earlier spring phenology observed in many plant species in recent decades provides compelling evidence that species are already responding to the rising global temperatures associated with anthropogenic climate change. There is great variability among species, however, in their phenological sensitivity to temperature. Species that do not phenologically ``track'' climate change may be at a disadvantage if their growth becomes limited by missed interactions with mutualists, or a shorter growing season relative to earlier-active competitors. Here, we set out to test the hypothesis that phenological sensitivity could be used to predict species performance in a warming climate, by synthesizing results across terrestrial warming experiments. We assembled data for 57 species across 24 studies where flowering or vegetative phenology was matched with a measure of species performance. Performance metrics included biomass, percent cover, number of flowers, or individual growth. We found that species that advanced their phenology with warming also increased their performance, whereas those that did not advance tended to decline in performance with warming. This indicates that species that cannot phenologically ``track'' climate may be at increased risk with future climate change, and it suggests that phenological monitoring may provide an important tool for setting future conservation priorities.},

	abstract = {{A method is proposed for assessing the relative importance of species
   identity, neighbour species influence and environment as determinants of
   change in community biomass composition in two-species short-term
   competition experiments. The method is based on modelling the
   differences in relative growth rates (RGR) of species ( hence called the
   RGRD method). Using a multiple regression approach it quantifies the
   effects of initial species' abundance, species identity and environment
   on RGRD and hence on change in community biomass composition. The RGRD
   approach is relatively simple to use and deals readily with statistical
   difficulties associated with correlated responses between species from
   the same stand. It can be easily adapted to analyse sequential harvest
   data. An example based on data from two-species mixtures of the annual
   species Stellaria media and Poa annua is used to illustrate the method.
   The main determinant of change in community biomass composition was
   species identity, reflected in the difference in growth rates between
   the species. Change in community composition was not, in general,
   significantly affected by the influence of neighbours or fertiliser
   level. The unimportance of the influence of neighbours in affecting the
   composition of these communities contrasts with the strong role of
   intra-and interspecific competition in determining the size of
   individuals of both species (Connolly et al. in Oecologia 82: 513 - 526,
   1990).}},

@article{Dickson2012,
	abstract = {Invasive, non-native plant species often outcompete native species and reduce biodiversity. Invasive plants frequently begin growth before native plants, yet few studies have examined whether invasives win in competition partly by colonizing disturbed sites more quickly or by beginning growth earlier in the season than native plants (i.e. due to priority effects). We hypothesized that invasive plant species would benefit more from priority effects than would comparable native species and that earlier growth of invasive species would decrease plant biodiversity. To test this hypothesis, we grew three pairs of invasive and native plant species from three different functional groups/plant families (C3 grasses/Poaceae, non-leguminous forbs/Asteraceae, and legumes/Fabaceae). We seeded each of the species 3 weeks before seeding the other five species into large pots in a greenhouse. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found much stronger priority effects with invasive than native species. Each invasive species formed a near-monocultures when seeded first (97.5 {\%} of total biomass, on average) whereas native species did not similarly dominate (29.8 {\%} of total biomass, on average). Similarly, Simpson's species diversity was 81 {\%} higher when the initially sown species was native rather than invasive. The literature suggests that invasive species in the field often begin growth earlier in the spring than native species and that climate change may increasingly allow invasives to begin growth before native species, indicating invasive priority effects may become increasingly common.},

   conditions in which the seed is able to germinate. It is determined by
   genetics with a substantial environmental influence which is mediated,
   at least in part, by the plant hormones abscisic acid and gibberellins.
   Not only is the dormancy status influenced by the seed maturation
   environment, it is also continuously changing with time following
   shedding in a manner determined by the ambient environment. As dormancy
   is present throughout the higher plants in all major climatic regions,
   adaptation has resulted in divergent responses to the environment.
   Through this adaptation, germination is timed to avoid unfavourable
   weather for subsequent plant establishment and reproductive growth. In
   this review, we present an integrated view of the evolution, molecular
   genetics, physiology, biochemistry, ecology and modelling of seed
   dormancy mechanisms and their control of germination. We argue that
   adaptation has taken place on a theme rather than via fundamentally
   different paths and identify similarities underlying the extensive

While a superior competitive ability has often been proposed as a major driver of successful plant invasions, its significance depends crucially on the timing of any competitive interaction. We assess whether a mismatch in germination phenology can favor the establishment of alien species, allowing them to exploit vacant niches where competition is low. As well as having important effects on the survival, growth and fitness of a species, asymmetric competition and potential soil legacies resulting from early or late germination can also impact on species recruitment. However, early or late germination comes at a cost, increases the risks of exposure to unfavorable conditions and requires an enhanced abiotic resistance if it is to lead to successful establishment.Important FindingsWhile there are several anecdotal accounts of early and late germination for invasive species, there are limited comparative data with resident species growing under natural conditions. Available evidence from grassland communities indicates that a short-term germination advantage or priority (few days/weeks) provides invasive species with a strong competitive advantage over native species and is a critical factor in many invasions. While the exploitation of periods of low competition is a plausible mechanism for the successful establishment of many invasive plants, direct evidence for this strategy is still scarce. This is particularly true with regard to the exploitation of late germination niches. Consequently, long-term comparative monitoring of the germination phenology of invasive and native plants in situ is needed to assess its significance in a range of ecosystems and its impact on community dynamics.},

	abstract = {{Assembly history, including the order in which species arrive into a
   community, can influence long-term community structure; however we know
   less about how timing of species arrival may alter assembly especially
   under varying resource conditions. To explore how the timing of species
   arrival interacts with resource availability to alter community
   assembly, we constructed experimental plant communities and manipulated
   the interval between plantings of groups of seedlings (0, 5, 10, 15 or
   20 days) at low and high levels of soil nutrient supply. To see if
   community changes influenced ecosystem-scale processes, we measured
   parameters across the plant -soil continuum (e.g. plant biomass and net
   ecosystem carbon dioxide exchange).
   We found that the timing of species arrival had a large impact on
   community assembly, but the size of the effect depended on soil
   fertility. As planting interval increased, plant communities diverged
   further from the control, but the divergence was stronger at high than
   at low nutrient supply. Our data suggest that at high nutrient supply,
   early-planted species preempted light resources more quickly, thus
   preventing the successful establishment of later arriving species even
   at short planting intervals. Finally, we found that assembly related
   divergence in plant communities scaled to impact ecosystem-level
   characteristics such as green leaf chemistry, but had little effect on
   total community biomass and net ecosystem exchange of CO2 and water
   vapor. Our data indicate that the effect of a stochastic factor, here
   the timing of species arrival on community composition, depends on the
   resource level under which the community assembles.}},

@article{Korner2008,
	abstract = {{`Who comes first' is decisive for plant community assembly and ecosystem
   properties. Early arrival or faster initial development of a species
   leads to space occupancy both above and below ground and contributes to
   species success. However, regular disturbance (e.g. biomass removal)
   might permit later-arriving or slower-developing species to catch up.
   Here, artificial communities of grassland species belonging to the plant
   functional types (PFTs) herb, grass and legume were used to test the
   effect of stepwise arrival (sowing) of PFTs.
   Dramatic effects were found as a result of a 3 wk arrival difference on
   composition and above-ground biomass that persisted over four harvests
   and two seasons. Priority effects, such as unequal germination time
   (arrival), and thus differences in community age structure, had lasting
   effects on PFT biomass contribution and associated ecosystem
   functioning. These effects were robust against above-ground disturbance.
   Benefits of earlier root formation outweighed above-ground species
   interaction.
   Earlier space occupancy and bigger reserve pools are the likely causes.
   Natural populations commonly exhibit age diversity and asynchrony of
   development among taxa. In experiments, artificial synchrony of arrival
   (sowing) may thus induce assembly routes favouring faster-establishing
   taxa, with consequences for ecosystem functioning (e.g. productivity).
   Founder effects, such as those observed here, could be even greater in
   communities of slow-growing species or forests, given their longer
   generation time and minor disturbance.}},

	abstract = {{At the core of plant regeneration, temperature and water supply are
   critical drivers for seed dormancy (initiation, break) and germination.
   Hence, global climate change is altering these environmental cues and
   will preclude, delay, or enhance regeneration from seeds, as already
   documented in some cases. Along with compromised seedling emergence and
   vigour, shifts in germination phenology will influence population
   dynamics, and thus, species composition and diversity of communities.
   Altered seed maturation (including consequences for dispersal) and seed
   mass will have ramifications on life history traits of plants. Predicted
   changes in temperature and precipitation, and thus in soil moisture,
   will affect many components of seed persistence in soil, e.g. seed
   longevity, dormancy release and germination, and soil pathogen activity.
   More/less equitable climate will alter geographic distribution for
   species, but restricted migratory capacity in some will greatly limit
   their response. Seed traits for weedy species could evolve relatively
   quickly to keep pace with climate change enhancing their negative
   environmental and economic impact. Thus, increased research in

Known as priority effects, these effects cause historical contingency in the structure and function of communities, resulting in alternative stable states, alternative transient states, or compositional cycles. The mechanisms of priority effects fall into two categories, niche preemption and niche modification, and the conditions for historical contingency by priority effects can be organized into two groups, those regarding regional species pool properties and those regarding local population dynamics. Specifically, two requirements must be satisfied for historical contingency to occur: The regional pool contains species that can together cause priority effects, and local dynamics are rapid enough for early-arriving species to preempt or modify niches before other species arrive. Organizing current knowledge this way reveals an outstanding key question: How are regional species pools that yield priority effects generated and maintained? },

   utility of predictions for stable states in explaining transient states
   remains unclear. Using a simple model of plant community assembly, we
   show that the conditions under which historical contingency affects
   community assembly can differ greatly for stable versus transient
   states. Differences arise because the contribution of such factors as
   mortality rate, environmental heterogeneity and plant-soil feedback to
   historical contingency changes as community assembly proceeds. We also
   show that transient states can last for a long time relative to
   immigration rate and generation time. These results argue for a
   conceptual shift of focus from alternative stable states to alternative
   transient states for understanding historical contingency in community
   assembly.}},
