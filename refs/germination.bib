In desert ecosystems of the southwestern USA, the forbs Brassica tournefortii, Erodium cicutarium and Schismus spp. dominate and alter native annual communities. Hand weeding B. tournefortii is currently the most common control method employed, but weeding is inadequate and expensive for managing large-scale invasions. New methods must be developed to conserve and restore desert ecosystems. 2.?Exotic annuals in desert systems have rapid germination and phenology compared to natives, indicating that a window for selective control of exotic annuals may occur immediately after exotic seedling emergence. We tested the role of timing in control methods by comparing a cotyledon-stage glyphosate application to a bolting-stage application and to hand weeding B. tournefortii, plus an untreated check. Treatments were tested at two sites dominated by either exotic or native annuals and followed for 2?years; early application was repeated the second year. Cover and richness were evaluated during seedling and peak flowering stages underneath and between shrubs. 3.?Early glyphosate application did not affect native cover, but did reduce exotic cover. Late herbicide negatively impacted both exotics and natives. Natives had little positive response, and then only through hand weeding under shrubs, but the same treatment caused an increase in the exotic E. cicutarium. 4. Synthesis and applications.?The rapid phenology of exotic annuals may be exploited to control exotics while minimizing impacts on native plants in desert communities. This approach may be useful for other invasions in other ecosystems by species with rapid, early germination, or may act as a supplement to improve the efficacy of existing management regimes.},

	n2 = {"The formation, dispersal and germination of seeds are crucial stages in the life cycles of gymnosperm and angiosperm plants. The unique properties of seeds, particularly their tolerance to desiccation, their mobility, and their ability to schedule their germination to coincide with times when environmental conditions are favorable to their survival as seedlings, have no doubt contributed significantly to the success of seed-bearing plants. Humans are also dependent upon seeds, which constitute the majority of the world's staple foods (e.g., cereals and legumes). Seeds are an excellent system for studying fundamental developmental processes in plant biology, as they develop from a single fertilized zygote into an embryo and endosperm, in association with the surrounding maternal tissues. As genetic and molecular approaches have become increasingly powerful tools for biological research, seeds have become an attractive system in which to study a wide array of metabolic processes and regulatory systems. Seed Development, Dormancy and Germination provides a comprehensive overview of seed biology from the point of view of the developmental and regulatory processes that are involved in the transition from a developing seed through dormancy and into germination and seedling growth. It examines the complexity of the environmental, physiological, molecular and genetic interactions that occur through the life cycle of seeds, along with the concepts and approaches used to analyze seed dormancy and germination behavior. It also identifies the current challenges and remaining questions for future research. The book is directed at plant developmental biologists, geneticists, plant breeders, seed biologists and graduate students."--NHBS Environment Bookstore.},

To understand the role of reproductive traits in successful invasion of the species, we studied several traits of its reproductive system: the miniature capitulum and gynomonoecious sexual system, the biology and phenology of capitula and florets, pollen/ovule ratio, the mating system (self-compatibility), flower visitors, physical traits and dispersal potential of achenes, germination potential of achenes from manually pollinated capitula, and the association of these traits with invasiveness. Our study showed that the reproductive traits of autonomous seed production, versatile mating system of self- and cross-pollination, and generalized pollination system might contribute to the species? successful invasive capability. The invasiveness was further enhanced by the high and rapid production of achenes, as well as the high percentage, rapid germination rate and high dispersal capability of achenes. It was concluded that in annual or winter-annual weeds, autonomous seed production contributed significantly to the invasiveness of the species.},

An experiment with synthesized grassland communities was performed to identify plant traits that contribute to invasiveness and community traits that promote invasibility, and to study the relationship between, and the relative importance of, invasiveness and invasibility. ? ? Eight perennial grass species were used both as invasible monocultures and as potential invaders in gaps in these monocultures. Invasion success in the establishment phase, and invader and monoculture traits were assessed. ? ? Invasion success expressed as germination correlated significantly with germination time (invader trait), light penetration in the gaps and N acquisition by the edge plants (monoculture traits). Success expressed as leaf length correlated with seed mass, germination time (invader traits) and light penetration. Forty-six per cent of the variation in germination was explained by invader identity and 8{\%} by monoculture identity, whereas, for leaf length, they explained 15{\%} and 18{\%}, respectively. ? ? Regenerative traits (seed mass and germination time) correlated with invasiveness, and resource availability (light and nitrogen) with invasibility. The results suggest that species characteristics would largely determine the extent of an invasion event (number of seedlings), while the success of individual invaders (growth and survival) is determined by both species and ecosystem characteristics.},

	abstract = {\&{\#}x2022; Background and Aims This study examined the adaptive association between seed germination ecology and specialization to either forest or open habitats across a range of evolutionary lineages of seed plants, in order to test the hypotheses that (1) species' specialization to open vs. shaded habitats is consistently accompanied by specialization in their regeneration niche; and (2) species are thereby adapted to utilize different windows of opportunity in time (season) and space (habitat). \&{\#}x2022; Methods Seed germination response to temperature, light and stratification was tested for 17 congeneric pairs, each consisting of one forest species and one open-habitat species. A factorial design was used with temperature levels and diurnal temperature variation (10 \&{\#}xb0;C constant, 15-5 \&{\#}xb0;C fluctuating, 20 \&{\#}xb0;C constant, 25-15 \&{\#}xb0;C fluctuating), and two light levels (light and darkness) and a cold stratification treatment. The congeneric species pair design took phylogenetic dependence into account. \&{\#}x2022; Key Results Species from open habitats germinated better at high temperatures, whereas forest species performed equally well at low and high temperatures. Forest species tended to germinate only after a period of cold stratification that could break dormancy, while species from open habitats generally germinated without cold stratification. The empirically derived germination strategies correspond quite well with establishment opportunities for forest and open-habitat plant species in nature. \&{\#}x2022; Conclusions Annual changes in temperature and light regime in temperate forest delimit windows of opportunity for germination and establishment. Germination strategies of forest plants are adaptations to utilize such narrow windows in time. Conversely, lack of fit between germination ecology and environment may explain why species of open habitats generally fail to establish in forests. Germination strategy should be considered an important mechanism for habitat specialization in temperate herbs to forest habitats. The findings strongly suggest that phases in the plant life cycle other than the established phase should be considered important in adaptive specialization.},

@article{Hess:2019vn,
	abstract = {Many anthropic activities generate soil disturbances, favoring competitive, fast growing invasive plant species at the expense of natives. Active restoration of invasion-resistant plant communities is increasingly recognized as a relevant strategy to combat invasive plant colonization in disturbed areas, but results are often unsatisfying. Historical effects, referred as ``priority effects''(i.e. the effects generated by the order in which species arrive at a local site), can have a major role in community assembly and invasion success because they involve early colonists altering the performance of later colonists. Taking these priority effects into account in restoration projects is emerging as a relevant way to improve native species restoration success and prevent invasion. The present review discusses two strategies considering priority effects that would help to achieve the classic restoration goal of ``more natives, less invasives''. The first strategy relies on tackling priority effects of invasive plants using different management options adapted to local environmental conditions, including removal, reduction of propagule sources, or mitigation of soil legacies. Indeed, invasive plants often generate strong priority effects providing themselves a substantial competitive advantage through early emergence and quick growth, but also self-induced soil modifications that can persist after their removal or death, commonly termed ``soil legacies''. In fertile and stable conditions, the reduction of invasive species priority effects must be coupled with the restoration of an invasion-resistant native plant cover to avoid reinvasion and secondary invasions. The second strategy is to bring about situations in which the restored native species are more likely to exert strong priority effects, decreasing invasion success. For this purpose, we sketch possible options open to restorationists based on resource or non-resource mechanisms. First, we discuss ways to maximize resource preemption by extending the time advance given to restored native species and manipulating restored species characteristics. Second, we consider the potential effect of increasing niche overlap between native and invasive species. Third, we introduce the potential manipulations of non-resource mechanisms, such as allelopathy, herbivory, disease, or the presence of mycorrhizae, to increase priority effects. This review incorporates recent research on priority effects to draw the outlines of priority effects-based restoration strategies and define future research questions that need to be addressed to test and improve these strategies.},

	abstract = {Forest light availability strongly regulates understory community composition, and low availability may confer resistance to invasion by exotic species, yet common buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica L.) invades North American temperate forests with a broad range of light habitats. It is unclear to what extent buckthorn's success is due to high mid-season shade tolerance versus shade avoidance permitted by early leaf out and late senescence. We used buckthorn seedlings planted into a forest diversity experiment in Cloquet, Minnesota, USA and a combined buckthorn physiology-canopy light model to test (1) how buckthorn germination, growth, and survival depend on canopy shading and (2) how canopy species richness and phenology affect light availability and buckthorn performance. Based on the mean of May, August, and October light measurements, we found that canopies that permitted ≤3{\%} transmission of incoming light had almost complete mortality of buckthorn and that growth of surviving buckthorn was strongly tied to light availability, but not canopy richness. Compared to deciduous canopies or deciduous-evergreen mixtures, evergreen canopies restricted light availability the most and led to the smallest and least likely to survive buckthorn. Our canopy models further indicated a tight linkage between buckthorn performance and spring and autumn light availability, but not summer light availability. We conclude that spring and autumn light availability are key regulators of buckthorn performance and that buckthorn relies on shade avoidance via an extended phenology to succeed in temperate forests. Consequently, we suggest species with extended spring or autumn canopy cover offer the greatest resistance to invasion, and communities which are often leafless during such periods are most vulnerable to invasion by buckthorn and similar invasive shrubs.},

For instance, resource availability and biotic interactions may represent ?filters? that limit the success of potential invaders. Communities are predicted to resist invasion when they contain native species that are functionally similar to potential invaders; where phenology may be a key functional trait. Nutrient reduction is another common strategy for reducing invasion following native species restoration, because soil nitrogen (N) enrichment often facilitates invasion. Here, we focus on restoring the herbaceous community associated with coastal sage scrub vegetation in Southern California; these communities are often highly invaded, especially by exotic annual grasses that are notoriously challenging for restoration. We created experimental plant communities composed of the same 20 native species, but manipulated functional group abundance (according to growth form, phenology, and N-fixation capacity) and soil N availability. We fertilized to increase N, and added carbon to reduce N via microbial N immobilization. We found that N reduction decreased exotic cover, and the most successful seed mix for reducing exotic abundance varied depending on the invader functional type. For instance, exotic annual grasses were least abundant when the native community was dominated by early active forbs, which matched the phenology of the exotic annual grasses. Our findings show that nutrient availability and the timing of biotic interactions are key filters that can be manipulated in restoration to prevent invasion and maximize native species recovery.},

	n2 = {Abstract Many high-impact invaders of temperate deciduous forests of Eastern North America exhibit extended leaf phenology compared to native species, with leaf emergence occurring earlier in the spring and abscission occurring later in the autumn. This observation indicates that extended phenology may be an important invasion mechanism for this system. However, most evidence that extended leaf phenology drives species invasion is anecdotal, and most studies that directly address the role of leaf phenology in invasion focus solely on increased invader growth. Beyond increasing invader growth, extended leaf phenology may drive invader impact on natives by (1) facilitating resource competition through nutrient pre-emption and shading, (2) altering production of secondary chemicals by invasive plants, (3) altering apparent competition dynamics mediated by native herbivores, (4) allowing temporal enemy escape, and (5) altering behaviour of native pollinators. I review current evidence from the literature regarding each of these possible consequences of extended invader phenology and emphasize the need for experimental manipulations to measure the extent to which extended leaf phenology mediates impact on the native community. Understanding the importance of leaf phenology in species invasion will facilitate prevention of future invasions while elucidating the role of seasonality in shaping species interactions.},

Phenological differences between exotic and native species may contribute to the success of invaders, yet a general theory for how phenology may shape invasions has not been developed. Shifts toward longer growing seasons, tracked by plant and animal species worldwide, heighten the need for this analysis. The concurrent availability of extensive citizen-science and long-term datasets has created tremendous opportunities to test the relationship between phenology and invasion. Here, we (1) extend major theories within community and invasion biology to include phenology, (2) develop a predictive framework to test these theories, and (3) outline available data resources to test predictions. By creating an integrated framework, we show how new analyses of long-term datasets could advance the fields of community ecology and invasion biology, while developing novel strategies for invasive species management. Although we focus here on terrestrial plants, our framework has clear extensions to animal communities and aquatic ecosystems as well.},

	abstract = {The germination behavior of a plant influences its fitness, persistence, and evolutionary potential, as well as its biotic environment. This can have major effects on the invasive potential of a species. We review the findings of four types of experimental studies comparing basic germination characteristics of invasive versus non-invasive congeners, in their non-native or native distribution range; invasive alien versus native species; and invasive species in their native versus non-native distribution range. Early and/or rapid germination is typical of invasive species rather than their non-invasive congeners, and represents a pre-adaptation from which many invasive and naturalized species benefit. It also occurs more often in invasive than native species, suggesting that competition mitigation or avoidance in the early stages of a plant's life, via the exploitation of vacant germination niches, might be more useful than a superior competitive ability in novel environments. This is further supported by a tendency of invasive species to germinate earlier and/or faster and have broader germination cues in their non-native than in their native range. It is also supported by broader germination requirements being reported for invasive species than their non-invasive or native congeners. In contrast, high percentage germination is not a consistent predictor of invasiveness, suggesting that the incorporation of a larger fraction of seed production into the soil seed bank rather than high germination is a better (or safer) strategy in novel environments. These patterns indicate that differences in the germination behavior of alien and native species contribute to the invasiveness of many species, although evidence under natural conditions is needed. The role of such differences in the establishment and spread of invasive species in novel environments and their long-term impact on community dynamics requires further study.},

	abstract = {{Exotic species are sometimes phenologically distinct from native species
   in the invaded community, allowing them to be active when there may be
   reduced competition for resources. In southern California, annual
   species are particularly problematic invaders, and prior work has shown
   that these species germinate earlier in the growing season, giving them
   a competitive advantage over later-germinating native species. This
   result begs the question, if being active earlier is advantageous, why
   have not native species adapted earlier cues for germination? We
   hypothesized native species would benefit less from earlier germination
   than exotic species (potentially due to slower growth following
   germination), thus negating potential selection for early germination.
   Here we manipulated planting time for common native and exotic species,
   growing them in all possible species pairs, to evaluate how competitive
   outcomes were altered by the time of arrival and the origin of competing
   species. In contrast to our hypotheses, the exotic species often had
   lower biomass when planted first, potentially due to disturbance when
   the second species was planted. In contrast, three out of our four
   native species benefited from earlier planting (a priority effect).
   Unlike the potential benefit of arriving early, we found no evidence
   that being planted one week later resulted in a competitive
   disadvantage, when compared to being planted simultaneously with a
   competitor. Further, we found that the magnitude and even direction of
   priority effects varied depending on the identity of the interacting
   species. Together these results suggest that a lack of directional
   selection may prevent adaptation towards earlier germination times of
   native species. Although this experiment was conducted with a limited
   suite of species, the results show that the role of seasonal priority
   effects varies among species, and that native species could benefit from
   seasonal priority effects in restoration efforts even when in
   competition with fast-growing exotic annual species.}},

	abstract = {{Competition is an important interaction in ecology, and many experiments
   have been done to examine the effects of intraspecific and interspecific
   competition. Unfortunately, most of these experiments have been done
   using either substitution or additive experimental designs. Substitution
   designs, and to a lesser extent additive designs, severely limit the
   useful inferences that ecologists can draw from the resulting data.
   Response surface experimental designs, which vary the densities of two
   competing species independently, offer the advantage of being able to
   compare the fits of alternative competition models and to estimate model
   parameters. This kind of experimental design has been relatively little
   used in ecology to date. I consider the use of response surface designs
   from two perspectives. The first is the optimal allocation of
   experimental effort among density treatments, with the goal of
   distinguishing among alternative models. Second, I compare the ability
   of six response surface designs to estimate known competition
   coefficients correctly, using simulated data. Low densities and
   densities near equilibrium in one generation tend to return similar
   densities the following generation and thus provide little or no
   information for comparing alternative population models. Experimental
   designs that span a wide range of densities, including high densities
   above carrying capacities, provide more accurate parameter estimates in
   general, but low densities are helpful for estimating population growth
   rates. Designs that are not fully factorial are one compromise solution
   that can yield accurate parameter estimates for models and yet require
   less experimental effort than full factorial surfaces. In general,
   response surfaces are a powerful class of experimental design and offer
   potentially stronger connections between empirical and theoretical
   approaches than traditional experimental designs.}},

MGT does not show the time from the start of imbibition to a specific germination percentage. MGT has been used to compare specific pairs or groups of means and to evaluate seed vigour. However, it is not the real time to mean germination but just an index of germination speed. Using MGT is not correct for ANOVA, post-ANOVA or the other comparison tests, because it does not show time to a specific germination percentage. Thus, we recommend that t50 be used instead of MGT. The t50 has all benefits of MGT, but it does not have the problems of MGT in treatment comparisons.},

However, many species produce nondormant seeds, particularly in wet tropical forests, a biogeographic pattern that is not well accounted for in current models. We hypothesized that the global distribution of dormant seeds derives from their adaptive value in predictably fluctuating (i.e. seasonal) environments. However, the advantage conferred by dormancy might ultimately depend on other seed attributes, particularly size. This general model was tested within a phylogenetically informed framework using a data set comprising > 216 000 world-wide observations of Fabaceae, spanning three orders of magnitude in seed size and including both dormant and nondormant seeds. Our results confirmed our hypothesis: nondormant seeds can only evolve in climates with long growing seasons and/or in lineages that produce larger seeds. Conversely, dormancy should be evolutionarily stable in temperate lineages with small seeds. When the favorable season is fleeting, seed dormancy is the only adaptive strategy. Based on these results, we predict that, within a given lineage, taxa producing larger, nondormant seeds will necessarily predominate in aseasonal environments, while plants bearing small, dormant seeds will be dominant under short growing seasons.},

However, the regenerative traits of seed dormancy and germination are underrepresented in this context. In the alpine zone, the large species and microhabitat diversity provide an ideal context to assess habitat-related regenerative strategies. To this end, seeds of 53 species growing in alpine siliceous and calcareous habitats (6230 and 6170 of EU Directive 92/43, respectively) were exposed to different temperature treatments under controlled laboratory conditions. Germination strategies in each habitat were identified by clustering with k-means. Then, phylogenetic least squares correlations (PGLS) were fitted to assess germination and dormancy differences between species? main habitat (calcareous and siliceous), microhabitat (grasslands, heaths, rocky, and species with no specific microhabitats), and chorology (arctic?alpine and continental). Calcareous and siliceous grasslands significantly differ in their germination behaviour with a slow, mostly overwinter germination and high germination under all conditions, respectively. Species with high overwinter germination occurs mostly in heaths and have an arctic?alpine distribution. Meanwhile, species with low or high germinability in general inhabit in grasslands or have no specific microhabitat (they belong to generalist), respectively. Alpine species use different germination strategies depending on habitat provenance, species? main microhabitat, and chorotype. Such differences may reflect adaptations to local environmental conditions and highlight the functional role of germination and dormancy in community ecology.},

Here, we systematically review the literature on priority effects by (1) synthesizing information from papers that compared simultaneous and nonsimultaneous planting or sowing; (2) discussing the mechanisms through which priority effects operate, (3) considering how these mechanisms might be manipulated to achieve restoration goals; and (4) highlighting future research needed to improve the use of priority effects in restoration. In a term-targeted search, we found 43 studies that experimentally manipulated the order of arrival of different species. Overall, these concluded that even small delays in arrival time, as opposed to simultaneous arrival of species, can promote differences in subsequent community composition as well as ecosystem functions. There were very few studies on the long-term stability of these priority effects, and the majority were conducted in temperate grasslands. Our findings suggest that creating alternative vegetation states via priority treatments is a promising avenue for restoration.

Using experiments and simulations, we show that both mechanisms consistently affect coexistence and that, contrary to long-held assumptions, the effect of relative nonlinearity can be larger in magnitude. These results may be general in that the simultaneous emergence of both mechanisms rests on two factors common to nearly all ecological systems, from the human gut to the soil microbiome: variable environmental conditions and saturating population growth rates.Understanding the origins and maintenance of biodiversity remains one of biology's grand challenges. From theory and observational evidence, we know that variability in environmental conditions through time is likely critical to the coexistence of competing species. Nevertheless, experimental tests of fluctuation-driven coexistence are rare and have typically focused on just one of two potential mechanisms, the temporal storage effect, to the neglect of the theoretically equally plausible mechanism known as relative nonlinearity of competition. We combined experiments and simulations in a system of nectar yeasts to quantify the relative contribution of the two mechanisms to coexistence. Resource competition models parameterized from single-species assays predicted the outcomes of mixed-culture competition experiments with 83{\%} accuracy. Model simulations revealed that both mechanisms have measurable effects on coexistence and that relative nonlinearity can be equal or greater in magnitude to the temporal storage effect. In addition, we show that their effect on coexistence can be both antagonistic and complementary. These results falsify the common assumption that relative nonlinearity is of negligible importance, and in doing so reveal the importance of testing coexistence mechanisms in combination.},

The spatial storage effect promotes coexistence when (1) species have unique vital rate responses to their spatial environment and, when abundant, (2) experience stronger competition in the environmental patches where they perform better. In a naturally occurring southwest Western Australian annual plant system, we conducted a neighbor removal experiment involving eleven focal species growing in high-abundance populations. Specifically, we measured species? fecundity across a variety of environmental gradients in both the presence and absence of neighbors. For the environmental variables that we measured, there was only limited evidence for species-specific responses to the environment, with a composite variable describing overstory cover and leaf litter cover being the best predictor of fecundity for a subset of focal species. In addition, although we found strong evidence for intraspecific competition, positive environment?competition covariance was only detected for one species. Thus, positive environment?competition covariance may not be as common as expected in populations of species growing at high abundance, at least when tested in natural assemblages. Our findings highlight the inherent limitations of using natural assemblages to study spatial coexistence mechanisms, and we urge empirical ecologists to take these limitations into account when designing future experiments.},

An emerging literature on priority effects suggests the manipulation of community assembly as a useful technique to help overcome these difficulties by altering competitive relationships. We present data from a set of four priority experiments, carried out at each of three sites in restoration settings in California grasslands. These data, combined with patterns summarized from the literature, indicate that both short-term priority (1?3 weeks) and long-term priority (1 year) can profoundly shift interspecific relationships and benefit otherwise subordinate plant species, but that these effects are sometimes transitory, asymmetric, and contingent on environmental conditions and species composition. Restoration interventions that can produce priority effects include staggered planting times, weed control, seed pre-germination, plug planting, and spatial aggregation. Such interventions are likely to be at least initially effective, but their strength and persistence can differ considerably across systems in space and time. Further research may help identify the conditions that maximize the strength and persistence of priority effects in restoration settings.},

The purpose of these studies was to determine if there are correlations between the dormancy breaking and germination requirements of seeds and the germination phenology, life cycle type, habitat requirements, range of geographical distribution, and phylogenetic relationships of the species. Germination phenology is highly correlated with the responses of seeds to the yearly temperature cycle. Species with winter and summer annual life cycles have predictable germination characteristics, but monocarpic and polycarpic perennials do not. Several dormancy types may be found in a given habitat, and narrowly endemic and widely-distributed species in the same genus may have similar germination characteristics. Within some families there is a tendency for a particular type of seed-temperature response to be very important, but frequently this is related to the predominance of a given life cycle type in the family.},

However, predicting how these changes affect the structure and long-term dynamics of natural communities is challenging because phenology and coexistence theory have largely proceeded independently. Here, I propose a conceptual framework that incorporates seasonal timing of species interactions into a well-studied competition model to examine how changes in phenologies influence long-term dynamics of natural communities. Using this framework I demonstrate that persistence and coexistence conditions strongly depend on the difference in species? mean phenologies and how this difference varies across years. Consequently, shifts in mean and interannual variation in relative phenologies of species can fundamentally alter the outcome of interactions and the potential for persistence and coexistence of competing species. These effects can be predicted by how per-capita effects scale with differences in species? phenologies. I outline how this approach can be parameterized with empirical systems and discuss how it fits within the context of current coexistence theory. Overall, this synthesis reveals that phenology of species interactions can play a crucial yet currently understudied role in driving coexistence and biodiversity patterns in natural systems and determine how species will respond to future climate change.},

	abstract = {{A model for simulating Polygonum aviculare L. seed dormancy loss in
   relation to stratification temperature was developed. The model employs
   the lower limit temperature for germination (T-l) as an index of seed
   population dormancy status. While population mean for T-l (T-l(50)) and
   T-l distribution within the population (sigma(Tl)) are allowed to vary
   as seeds are released from dormancy, other thermal parameters
   characterizing the germination thermal responses (base, optimal and
   maximal temperatures, and thermal time required for germination) and the
   higher limit temperature for germination (T-h) are held constant. In
   order to relate changes in T-l(50) and sigma(Tl) to variable time and
   temperature, a stratification thermal time index (S-tt) was developed,
   which consists of the accumulation of thermal time units under a
   threshold temperature for dormancy loss to occur. Therefore, T-l(50) and
   sigma(Tl) varied in relation to the accumulation of S-tt according to
   time and temperature. To derive model equations, changes in seed
   population thermal parameters were estimated for buried seeds stored at
   1.6, 7 and 12degreesC for 110 d. Seeds were exhumed at regular
   intervals, and were incubated at 15degreesC and at a gradually
   increasing temperature regime in the range 6-25degreesC. The germination
   time-course curves obtained were reproduced using a mathematical model.
   Thermal parameters that best fit simulated and experimentally obtained
   germination time-course curves were determined. Model performance was
   evaluated against data of two unrelated experiments, showing acceptable
   prediction of timing and percentage of germination of seeds exhumed from

   useful tools for determining the most suitable time for weed seedling
   control and, consequently, should result in a higher efficacy of applied

   functional relationships should be established between environmental
   factors regulating dormancy and dormancy changes of seed populations. In
   the present work, we used a simple model and an optimisation procedure
   to quantify the effect of temperature on Polygonum aviculare seed
   dormancy release and induction, based on germination data. Dormancy
   release rate was inversely related to temperature, showing a decreasing
   logistic trend that results in no dormancy release for seeds exposed to
   20 and 25 degrees C. In contrast, dormancy induction rates in absolute
   values were positively associated with temperature, showing a logistic
   trend in which dormancy induction was almost zero at low temperatures
   and maximal at 25 degrees C. Derived model parameters were used to
   simulate dormancy changes of P. aviculare seeds stored under controlled

	abstract = {{Temperature is a key factor affecting both dormancy and germination. In
   non-dormant seeds, when temperature is within the thermal range
   permissive for germination, it just regulates germination velocity,
   while in seeds presenting dormancy it can also be affecting dormancy

   dual effect of temperature on dormancy and germination often leads to
   misinterpretation of obtained germination results and confounds the
   analysis of temperature effects in seed populations presenting some

   temperature in the regulation of dormancy level and its implications in
   dormancy expression, as an attempt to construct a conceptual framework
   that allows distinguishing between the effects of temperature on
   dormancy and germination. Finally, we present examples of how a better

   effects of temperature on both processes during incubation of seeds

	abstract = {Earlier spring phenology observed in many plant species in recent decades provides compelling evidence that species are already responding to the rising global temperatures associated with anthropogenic climate change. There is great variability among species, however, in their phenological sensitivity to temperature. Species that do not phenologically ``track'' climate change may be at a disadvantage if their growth becomes limited by missed interactions with mutualists, or a shorter growing season relative to earlier-active competitors. Here, we set out to test the hypothesis that phenological sensitivity could be used to predict species performance in a warming climate, by synthesizing results across terrestrial warming experiments. We assembled data for 57 species across 24 studies where flowering or vegetative phenology was matched with a measure of species performance. Performance metrics included biomass, percent cover, number of flowers, or individual growth. We found that species that advanced their phenology with warming also increased their performance, whereas those that did not advance tended to decline in performance with warming. This indicates that species that cannot phenologically ``track'' climate may be at increased risk with future climate change, and it suggests that phenological monitoring may provide an important tool for setting future conservation priorities.},

	abstract = {{A method is proposed for assessing the relative importance of species
   identity, neighbour species influence and environment as determinants of
   change in community biomass composition in two-species short-term
   competition experiments. The method is based on modelling the
   differences in relative growth rates (RGR) of species ( hence called the
   RGRD method). Using a multiple regression approach it quantifies the
   effects of initial species' abundance, species identity and environment
   on RGRD and hence on change in community biomass composition. The RGRD
   approach is relatively simple to use and deals readily with statistical
   difficulties associated with correlated responses between species from
   the same stand. It can be easily adapted to analyse sequential harvest
   data. An example based on data from two-species mixtures of the annual
   species Stellaria media and Poa annua is used to illustrate the method.
   The main determinant of change in community biomass composition was
   species identity, reflected in the difference in growth rates between
   the species. Change in community composition was not, in general,
   significantly affected by the influence of neighbours or fertiliser
   level. The unimportance of the influence of neighbours in affecting the
   composition of these communities contrasts with the strong role of
   intra-and interspecific competition in determining the size of
   individuals of both species (Connolly et al. in Oecologia 82: 513 - 526,
   1990).}},

	abstract = {Invasive, non-native plant species often outcompete native species and reduce biodiversity. Invasive plants frequently begin growth before native plants, yet few studies have examined whether invasives win in competition partly by colonizing disturbed sites more quickly or by beginning growth earlier in the season than native plants (i.e. due to priority effects). We hypothesized that invasive plant species would benefit more from priority effects than would comparable native species and that earlier growth of invasive species would decrease plant biodiversity. To test this hypothesis, we grew three pairs of invasive and native plant species from three different functional groups/plant families (C3 grasses/Poaceae, non-leguminous forbs/Asteraceae, and legumes/Fabaceae). We seeded each of the species 3 weeks before seeding the other five species into large pots in a greenhouse. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found much stronger priority effects with invasive than native species. Each invasive species formed a near-monocultures when seeded first (97.5 {\%} of total biomass, on average) whereas native species did not similarly dominate (29.8 {\%} of total biomass, on average). Similarly, Simpson's species diversity was 81 {\%} higher when the initially sown species was native rather than invasive. The literature suggests that invasive species in the field often begin growth earlier in the spring than native species and that climate change may increasingly allow invasives to begin growth before native species, indicating invasive priority effects may become increasingly common.},

While a superior competitive ability has often been proposed as a major driver of successful plant invasions, its significance depends crucially on the timing of any competitive interaction. We assess whether a mismatch in germination phenology can favor the establishment of alien species, allowing them to exploit vacant niches where competition is low. As well as having important effects on the survival, growth and fitness of a species, asymmetric competition and potential soil legacies resulting from early or late germination can also impact on species recruitment. However, early or late germination comes at a cost, increases the risks of exposure to unfavorable conditions and requires an enhanced abiotic resistance if it is to lead to successful establishment.Important FindingsWhile there are several anecdotal accounts of early and late germination for invasive species, there are limited comparative data with resident species growing under natural conditions. Available evidence from grassland communities indicates that a short-term germination advantage or priority (few days/weeks) provides invasive species with a strong competitive advantage over native species and is a critical factor in many invasions. While the exploitation of periods of low competition is a plausible mechanism for the successful establishment of many invasive plants, direct evidence for this strategy is still scarce. This is particularly true with regard to the exploitation of late germination niches. Consequently, long-term comparative monitoring of the germination phenology of invasive and native plants in situ is needed to assess its significance in a range of ecosystems and its impact on community dynamics.},

	abstract = {{Assembly history, including the order in which species arrive into a
   community, can influence long-term community structure; however we know
   less about how timing of species arrival may alter assembly especially
   under varying resource conditions. To explore how the timing of species
   arrival interacts with resource availability to alter community
   assembly, we constructed experimental plant communities and manipulated
   the interval between plantings of groups of seedlings (0, 5, 10, 15 or
   20 days) at low and high levels of soil nutrient supply. To see if
   community changes influenced ecosystem-scale processes, we measured
   parameters across the plant -soil continuum (e.g. plant biomass and net
   ecosystem carbon dioxide exchange).
   We found that the timing of species arrival had a large impact on
   community assembly, but the size of the effect depended on soil
   fertility. As planting interval increased, plant communities diverged
   further from the control, but the divergence was stronger at high than
   at low nutrient supply. Our data suggest that at high nutrient supply,
   early-planted species preempted light resources more quickly, thus
   preventing the successful establishment of later arriving species even
   at short planting intervals. Finally, we found that assembly related
   divergence in plant communities scaled to impact ecosystem-level
   characteristics such as green leaf chemistry, but had little effect on
   total community biomass and net ecosystem exchange of CO2 and water
   vapor. Our data indicate that the effect of a stochastic factor, here
   the timing of species arrival on community composition, depends on the
   resource level under which the community assembles.}},

	abstract = {{`Who comes first' is decisive for plant community assembly and ecosystem
   properties. Early arrival or faster initial development of a species
   leads to space occupancy both above and below ground and contributes to
   species success. However, regular disturbance (e.g. biomass removal)
   might permit later-arriving or slower-developing species to catch up.
   Here, artificial communities of grassland species belonging to the plant
   functional types (PFTs) herb, grass and legume were used to test the
   effect of stepwise arrival (sowing) of PFTs.
   Dramatic effects were found as a result of a 3 wk arrival difference on
   composition and above-ground biomass that persisted over four harvests
   and two seasons. Priority effects, such as unequal germination time
   (arrival), and thus differences in community age structure, had lasting
   effects on PFT biomass contribution and associated ecosystem
   functioning. These effects were robust against above-ground disturbance.
   Benefits of earlier root formation outweighed above-ground species
   interaction.
   Earlier space occupancy and bigger reserve pools are the likely causes.
   Natural populations commonly exhibit age diversity and asynchrony of
   development among taxa. In experiments, artificial synchrony of arrival
   (sowing) may thus induce assembly routes favouring faster-establishing
   taxa, with consequences for ecosystem functioning (e.g. productivity).
   Founder effects, such as those observed here, could be even greater in
   communities of slow-growing species or forests, given their longer
   generation time and minor disturbance.}},

@article{Walck2011,
	abstract = {{At the core of plant regeneration, temperature and water supply are
   critical drivers for seed dormancy (initiation, break) and germination.
   Hence, global climate change is altering these environmental cues and
   will preclude, delay, or enhance regeneration from seeds, as already
   documented in some cases. Along with compromised seedling emergence and
   vigour, shifts in germination phenology will influence population
   dynamics, and thus, species composition and diversity of communities.
   Altered seed maturation (including consequences for dispersal) and seed
   mass will have ramifications on life history traits of plants. Predicted
   changes in temperature and precipitation, and thus in soil moisture,
   will affect many components of seed persistence in soil, e.g. seed
   longevity, dormancy release and germination, and soil pathogen activity.
   More/less equitable climate will alter geographic distribution for
   species, but restricted migratory capacity in some will greatly limit
   their response. Seed traits for weedy species could evolve relatively
   quickly to keep pace with climate change enhancing their negative
   environmental and economic impact. Thus, increased research in
   understudied ecosystems, on key issues related to seed ecology, and on
   evolution of seed traits in nonweedy species is needed to more fully
   comprehend and plan for plant responses to global warming.}},

@article{Fukami2015,
	abstract = { The order and timing of species immigration during community assembly can affect species abundances at multiple spatial scales. Known as priority effects, these effects cause historical contingency in the structure and function of communities, resulting in alternative stable states, alternative transient states, or compositional cycles. The mechanisms of priority effects fall into two categories, niche preemption and niche modification, and the conditions for historical contingency by priority effects can be organized into two groups, those regarding regional species pool properties and those regarding local population dynamics. Specifically, two requirements must be satisfied for historical contingency to occur: The regional pool contains species that can together cause priority effects, and local dynamics are rapid enough for early-arriving species to preempt or modify niches before other species arrive. Organizing current knowledge this way reveals an outstanding key question: How are regional species pools that yield priority effects generated and maintained? },

@article{Fukami2011,
	abstract = {{The concept of alternative stable states has long been a dominant
   framework for studying the influence of historical contingency in
   community assembly. This concept focuses on stable states, yet many real
   communities are kept in a transient state by disturbance, and the
   utility of predictions for stable states in explaining transient states
   remains unclear. Using a simple model of plant community assembly, we
   show that the conditions under which historical contingency affects
   community assembly can differ greatly for stable versus transient
   states. Differences arise because the contribution of such factors as
   mortality rate, environmental heterogeneity and plant-soil feedback to
   historical contingency changes as community assembly proceeds. We also
   show that transient states can last for a long time relative to
   immigration rate and generation time. These results argue for a
   conceptual shift of focus from alternative stable states to alternative
   transient states for understanding historical contingency in community
   assembly.}},
